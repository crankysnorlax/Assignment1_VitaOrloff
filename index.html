												<p>My main interest in IT is video games. Not only do I spend a lot of my time gaming, but I watch a lot of people stream their gameplay, as well. My interest in IT also stems from the sheer awe I feel at the technological progress happening before us. It is impressive how much IT has developed as an academic and utilitarian discipline. I feel incredibly lucky to be a part of the generation that witnessed the rise of technology. The rapid advancement of the IT field demonstrates its capacity for continued growth at an exponential rate, which further solidifies my interest in studying this discipline.</p>

												<p>My interest in IT was sparked at a young age. Growing up, I had access to computers and video game consoles. The 90s were a different time for IT; there was a lot of dreaming and planning in the field, and no one knew quite yet how much tech development would explode. My mother worked hard for her Master’s degree in IT. She felt that this burgeoning field would play a very important role in humanity’s history and wanted to ensure that her family would be a part of its inevitable rise. Without her influence, I would not have the interests I have today. I fondly remember playing old video games with her, as well as being taught how to navigate the Windows 98 interface.</p>

												<p>I chose to come to RMIT to improve my understand of IT. The title of the school, “Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology”, implied that it would be a legitimate source of IT knowledge. This encouraged me to apply. I have essentially no experience in IT, aside from occasionally dabbling in coding. I played a lot of Neopets as a kid, and they had free HTML tutorials on their site. That was my first experience with a programming language. I messed around with Java and Python a bit after that, but didn’t get very far with either language. My hope in attending the IT program at RMIT is to attain experience in coding and program design. I expect to learn some of the more prevalent programming languages and heighten my problem-solving skills.</p>

									<h3>Game Programmer</h3>

									<p>The position of Game Programmer is very straight-forward. A person in this role would be maintaining the code of the existing game engine. This would include debugging, redesigning, and general problem-solving. The main programming language used would be C++. Along with general maintenance, some ingenuity would expected, as well. The programming specialist in this role would work on the creation and implementation of new systems, such as user interfaces, and would also be expected to contribute to the brainstorming of future game titles. This position is particularly appealing to me because it aligns with my personal interests, and the company appears to provide space for the creativity and individuality of its employees.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
								<section class="highlight">
									
									<p>This position requires quite a few skills and qualifications for consideration. For starters, the applicant must have a Bachelor’s degree in software engineering, computer science, or other relevant discipline. Fluency in C++ is mandatory. Experience in software programming, debugging, and optimization is also expected. In addition to these skills, adaptability and the ability to work in a team are major requirements for the role. I am a quick learner with a self-motivated attitude, which is something they are looking for in an applicant; however, my technical experience is nowhere near the level necessary to qualify me for the position. I will obtain the skills necessary for this role through my studies at RMIT. Fluency in C++ will be a result of my personal edification and will be prioritized in my free-time.</p>

								The results of these tests has revealed much to me about my working/learning style. As an ENTJ, I will be an ambitious addition to any team. That being said, I’ll have to take extra care to be less demanding and more emotionally gentle with my colleagues, for the sake of teamwork. Knowing that I am a visual learner will greatly assist me in any future training I will receive. Understanding my Big 5 Results will help me integrate with a future team more efficiently. I can’t deny that receiving a “Neuroticism” result of 100% was a bit jarring, but that information will be useful nonetheless. When forming a team, I’ll look for colleagues that do not recoil from authoritative tones and work well within a high-degree of organization. I will also try to comprise my team of people who do not respond negatively to direct (but constructive) criticism.

					<div class="title">Project Idea</div>
					<div class="container">
						
					
						<p class="style1">
							<div><strong>Overview</strong></div>
							This project will be the development of a game using Unreal Engine. The game will be called “The Floor is Lava”, reminiscent of that game we all most likely played as kids. It will be a side-scrolling game, where the user can make a character jump and run across the screen. The main objective of the game is to reach the end of the level safely. There will be platforms to jump onto, as well as gaps in the floor containing lava. The difficulty will progress with each level, and the final level will include a monster chase.
						</p>
						<p class="style1">
						<div><strong>Motivation</strong></div>
							This project will be interesting because it will be fun to play. Any person who enjoys video games will hopefully enjoy this game. It will be a bit simplistic in nature, but that will not be a deterrent for users. In fact, that will be an inviting characteristic of the game. Many games on the market today are unnecessarily complicated and incur an enormous learning curve for new users. Users sometimes lose interest in a new game because it is too inaccessible to new players who have little-to-no familiarity with the game mechanics. “The Floor is Lava” will be accessible to users of all ages and skill levels. A high-level of familiarity with side-scrolling games will not be required. The straight-forward design of the game will allow everyone to play and enjoy themselves.
						</p>
						<p class="style1">
							<div><strong>Description</strong></div>
							<div>The game will be a side-scrolling game. The main character will be a kid jumping from item to item, imagining that the floor is made of lava. There will be platforms and household objects for him to jump onto. If he falls into a designated gap, lava will consume him, and the level restarts. If the player successfully reaches the door to the next room, the level ends and the player advances to the next level. There will be a total of 4 levels.</div>
							<div><br>The starting menu will be that of the main character standing outside his house. Once the “Start” button is clicked, a walking cutscene is triggered. The character enters the house and walks into his bedroom. He sees imaginary lava (perhaps indicated as imaginary through its opacity) and jumps atop a nearby dresser. The user is now able to control the character and the first level begins.</div>
							<div><br>The main design of each level will be that of a specific room in the house, with the main character jumping across common household items such as couches, televisions, and tables. The first level will be the kid’s bedroom, the second level will be the living room, the third level will be the kitchen, and the fourth level will be the backyard. Each level will have a minimum of 5 lava gaps, each of varying length.</div>
							<div><br>The fourth level will contain a chase element, in addition to the pre-existing level conditions. A giant lava monster will be the final boss at the very end, chasing the main character across the screen. The lava monster cannot follow the player up onto platforms, but it will not pass by if the player is out of reach. The lava monster will wait under the player and perform grabbing animations until the player has left the platform. When the character successfully reaches the end of the final level, the lava monster melts away. A walking cutscene is triggered, and the character walks back into the starting menu.</div>
						</p>
						<p class="style1">
							<div><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></div>
								The only tools required are a computer capable of running Unreal Engine and the Unreal Engine application. According to Unreal’s website, Unreal Engine version 4.26 should be used with recommended specs of 8GB RAM, a DirectX 11 video card, and a Quad-core Intel or AMD processor that runs at 2.5 GHz or faster. GitHub will most likely be a valuable resource for the team working on this project. Any edits or changes can be accessed by all team members at all times through GitHub.
						</p>
						<p class="style1">
							<div><strong>Skills Required</strong></div>
							An intermediate level of skills is required for this project. Familiarity with Unreal Engine is mandatory. Fluency in C++ is not necessary if you can effectively navigate the Unreal Engine application, as it provides coding assistance. Some artistic ability is recommended, as well. Short animations and the overall design of the game will need to be overseen by an artist. It will be extremely feasible to find the skills, software, and hardware required.
						</p>
						<p class="style1">
							<div><strong>Outcome</strong></div>
							If this project is successful, the outcome will be a fun game that can be played by all sorts of people from any technological background. One issue that is prevalent in the video game market is that of inaccessible games. “The Floor is Lava” could potentially solve that issue. Instead of jumping through hoops to learn new game mechanics, a new player could simply pick up the game and enjoy it immediately. This game will not have a huge impact on the gaming market. However, it will be a small and fun distraction for any person who sees fit to pick it up.
